# ClusterIP: Request comes through ingress and points to service name and port.

# port: Internal cluster service port for container and listens for incoming request from the nodeport and forwards to targetPort.

# targetPort: Receives the request from port and forwards to container pod(port) where it's listening. Even if you don't specify this will get by default assigned the same port numbers as port.
